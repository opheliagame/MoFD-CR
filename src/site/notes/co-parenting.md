"I'm too worried to agree to have a baby with someone I don't know well. 'Co-parenting.' What if they leave and never actually wanted me to be involved?" He pauses and looks at me carefully. I know what he's thinkingâ€”could we do this together? One man, one woman, making a baby and [[parenthood\|co-parenting as friends]]? He won't ask because he's too polite, and I can't offer. I only want a baby on my own. I can't bear to see a man who isn't Anthony parent my child. I can't.
