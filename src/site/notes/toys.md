*I’m saying if we want to break an old pattern, we need to envision a new pattern in its place. If we want to break the pattern of typical two-parent, even queer two-parent nuclear families, we have to think through the logistics of the replacement. I’m not one of those people who thinks all problems get solved by some human-centered design. We’re proposing a family, not a tech start-up…but it’s also true that part of being queer can be a design problem. I mean, Jesus, just look at our sex toys.*
