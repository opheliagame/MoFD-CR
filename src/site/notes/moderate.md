There was a utopic aspect to the way that Katrina talked about coparenting, the way that recently out queers proclaimed their romantic loves and predilections with the most fervor, still innocent of the thorns inherent to queer life. In her more paranoid, cruel moments, Reese braced herself for Katrinaâ€™s coming abandonment, the way that a queer girl tries to moderate her desire for the heterosexual college girl who has been excitedly returning her kisses in the wake of an asshole boyfriend leaving her.
