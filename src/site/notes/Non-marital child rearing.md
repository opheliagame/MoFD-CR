One of the many ways to raise children.

According to the US Vital Registration System, children born to parents who are not legally married at the time of birth are considered "illegitimate" or "bastard". 

Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act states
> **Section 16: Legitimacy of children of void and voidable marriages.**
> 
> Notwithstanding that a marriage is null and void under section 11, any child of such marriage who would have been legitimate if the marriage had been valid, shall be legitimate, whether such child is born before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 (68 of 1976), and whether or not a decree of nullity is granted in respect of that marriage under this Act and whether or not the marriage is held to be void otherwise than on a petition under this Act.

Japanese Civil Code 民法（明治二十九年法律第八十九号）states among others [^1]
> ２嫡出でない子は、母の氏を称する。
> (2)A child not born in wedlock takes the surname of the mother.
