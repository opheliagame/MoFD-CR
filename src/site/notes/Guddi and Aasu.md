'I am 19 and my friend Aasu is 21. She lives in the next house. We have known each other for five years. We would be living together openly today, had my mother not interfered. First of all, she forcibly got me married off. It has been one year since the marriage. But I only stayed in my in-laws' house for three months....They constantly say, go back, go back. I have replied, I will go back on condition that Aasu comes with me. I will live with her only.'
