The Ministry of Family Development and Child-rearing was formed in 34673 with the mission of supporting our citizens in constructing the families that they want to be a part of. 

For a long time, we had the [[Nuclear family\|Nuclear family]] and [[Joint family\|Joint family]] systems in place. Anything outside these structures was seen as deviating from the norm and found to be somehow lacking in the general opinion. It was hard for people to imagine and create the family configurations that would have most suited their life.

But we have come a long way. And there is even further to go. 
Up until now, we have had doctors, researchers, scientists and artists inform our understanding of how new family structures can be created and how they can enable the growth and development of both adults and children. This important work has led us to make many new discoveries and enriched our understanding of the ways in which societies have and can organize themselves. 

In spite of the immense efforts, we think that progress has been slow to come. We believe that by involving you, the general public, who stands to benefit the most by these discussions, we can do much more. 

This survey was designed to help you understand the kind of family that you think is most suited to you, and what it would take to build it with the people that you love. 

We cannot wait to hear what you have to say. 
Happy brainstorming!
