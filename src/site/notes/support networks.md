How will I do everything I did before, alone? Looking after a newborn, working full-time, raising a child, being the only breadwinner, being the [[as many moms\|only parent]]. It sends a cold dread into the pit of my stomach. I think, with longing, of the Dutch Matron system that is working so well in the Neterlands. There was a documentary about it on the BBC. They interviewed the Dutch prime minister. Single women with children, if they wanted, were placed in zones, grouping the women together to create formal support networks. Each ward is made up of between four and six families. The women take turns staying home to take care of the children; a few months of the year at home, the rest of the year working full-time.
