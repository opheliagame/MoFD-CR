A lot of people Dorothy knew said that they didn't want to have children because they couldn't count on the world existing for them. But Dorothy thought that the world simply was whatever children were born into. At least, that was the kind of thing she thought in theory. When she imagined the children of the future, the metaphorical children, they were floating on rafts roped together with the fall coats everyone had thrown away because there was no more fall, just as there was no more spring, although come brutal winter they would need to suture all the in-between-season coats together for warmth.
