The great question of our time: How to find love when there are literally no men left? The phrases single women always used to hear like 'there's plenty of fish in the sea' and 'as soon as you stop [[apes\|looking]] for love, it'll find you' do not apply anymore. The sea is empty. It became the thing to talk about, when you weren't talking about who else had died: How am I going to meet someone? Even in the apocalypse, human beings have the same needs. We all want to feel loved, to be desired, to feel like we're not alone in this insane, terrifying world.
