The recent upsurge in interest in co-living builds upon a much longer tradition of cohousing often associated with early developments in Denmark in the 1960s. These communal housing projects (bof√¶llesskab), which sparked an international movement against the single-family home, have been called a "Danish blueprint for utopian existence." Unlike co-living, cohousing tends to be intergenerational and attempts to find an ideal balance between privacy and community. [Cohousing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohousing) also allows for private or collective homeownership, as opposed to the rental options primarily available through [[co-living\|co-living]], making cohousing a more permanent arrangement.
