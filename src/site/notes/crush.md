Is there such a thing as a mom-crush? Certainly there is a friendcrush, and of course, a typical crush-crush, but Reese would call what she feels for Katrina a mom-crush. Every morning for more than a week now, she has woken up thinking about being a co-mom with Katrina, picturing her future self five years hence, in hopeful domestic scenes. For instance, this very day, on the way to Katrinaâ€™s, she imagined Katrina and herself in the grocery store, deciding whether or not it is okay to make Kraft mac and cheese for their child.
