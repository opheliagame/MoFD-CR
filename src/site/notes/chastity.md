And unlike the poverty and chastity demanded of monastics, Fourier imagined collective abundance, free love, and communally raised children, although he allowed for private property and some social stratification. Residents who had joined the community with preexisting wealth enjoyed more luxurious rooms, but they took their common meals in a dining hall with anyone in the community who had a taste for more exclusive foods and wines. Fourier believed that some level of inequality was unavoidable, and as long as all residents lived in conditions of relative adundance, differences in dispositions (or what Fourier called "passions") would not fuel envy or discord.
