Danish feminist named Bodil Graae wrote a groundbreaking article called "Children Should Have One Hundred Parents," where she argued that communal living would lead to a safer, more supportive, and happier environment for children. Graae's essay explicitly challenged the nuclear family and single-family dwellings, advocating for a profound transformation of the prevailing concept of "home." The following year, when [Gudmand-HÃ¸yer](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Gudmand-H%C3%B8yer) published an article defending the communitarian goals of collective living in a Danish newspaper, over a hundred families wrote in to express their interest in living in such a development.
