It was obvious immediately that I hadn't been hired to be a nanny; I had been hired to be a [[alone\|mother]]. Mrs Tai pays the children hardly any attention. She says good morning and good night to them and that's it. I'm there for kissing bruised arms better and pinning their paintings onto the nursery wall and saying, "Yes we can watch Moana again but only if we watch Lilo & Stitch tomorrow and no we can't have Frozen until next week, I don't want to let it go again, that ice lady needs a time-out!" I hear their laughs and their cries and their mumbles in their sleep and I know what temperature Rupert likes the milk he still has at night that I really need to wean him off of, but it's a good source of calcium and I'll let him have it for a few more weeks.
