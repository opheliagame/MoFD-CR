But I didn't throw the water over Susan because of grief. No. I did it because I'm childless and Susan knows that it's the one weakness I can't bear to have poked and she just rammed the knife in. I know we're meant to use the term "child-free" now but, let's face it, that's bullshit. Most of us are childless and not by choice. Daniel and I started trying for a baby as soon as we were married. By the time he died, we had been married for five years. I have been pregnant eight times and miscarried every single time.
