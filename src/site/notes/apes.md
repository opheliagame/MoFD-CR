I just remember this one night, after I lost the baby, all the men, once the show started, sort of unfurled themselves around their wives, and each wife settled into her respective husbandâ€™s arms contentedly. These bonded animal pairs. And suddenly they all looked like apes grooming each other. I was revolted. And [[laundry\|Danny]], you could see that he was leaning back on the sectional, opening his long arms so that I would place myself in them like all the other good wives.
