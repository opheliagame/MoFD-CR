When I'm doing the washing-up or sitting on the sofa, I'll drift for a few moments into an alternative world. What would it be like without Sean? How would I cope? Who would I be? We're so entwined the answers quickly come into focus. It would be awful. I wouldn't cope. I have no idea who I would be. We've been together since we were thirteen. We're childhood sweethearts. I went straight from living with my parents to living with him when I was seventeen. I don't know any other life. Sean and Helen. Helen and Sean.
