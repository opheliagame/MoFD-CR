Initially, Buddhist monks and nuns practiced an eremitic (or solitary) form of monasticism, but after the death of Gautama Buddha, they settled together, first for the rainy season and later in more permanent collectives, making Buddhist monasticism one of the earliest known forms of intentional communal living practiced by a group of spiritual seekers. Living together initially allowed them to pool resources, but later helped reinforce their mutual dedication to following the Middle Way, the teachings of the Buddha.
