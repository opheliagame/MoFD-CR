I'm generally suspicious when people are said to 'adore' other people, especially when they've been given no choice over who those people are, but Justine did always seem to have taken to Tony right from the start and to have trusted him; and Tony, I believe, could not have loved Justine more had she been his own daughter. Most people are incapable of that disinterested kind of love, but Tony had no biological children and no blood relatives, and can love who he likes.
